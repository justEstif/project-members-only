# Goals:

- Using passportjs
In this project youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts.
Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This will be a chance for you to use the authentication skills we learned in the last project, you will also be practicing your database skills so buckle up!

# Using:

- Express, Mongodb, Typescript
- EJS, Tailwind
- passportjs
